# website

A simple small (website) ; Personal corner of the internet.

---

## Description

This is both a template and reference implementation for a simple small website.
It tries it best to be accessible (APCA bronze-level compliant), modern (HTML5),
open (0BSD license), and small (less than 512kB).

See the reference implementation at [https://mergesort.net](https://mergesort.net)
.

## Changes

The reference implementation uses the Cloudflare compute and network. This means
that, changes from the build tool aside, the source will be changed.

Here is a list of known changes:

- JavaScript injection: At least one instance observed (email protection).

## License

On a webpage, correlating content to the correct license can be difficult. The
following lists will try to aid this process.

[0BSD](LICENSE):

- HTML element tag placement (i.e \<p\>)
- LICENSE
- README.md
- css/main.css
- robots.txt

MIT:

- css/normalize.css

All-Rights-Reserved:

- HTML content (i.e the text *in-between* \<p\>)

The footer of each page tries its best to track the active license(s). For
example, some pages may have a more permissive license for HTML content.
